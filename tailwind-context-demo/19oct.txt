context - React 16 
state mgmt - ex - isLoggedIn ,email
we can decide the Provider.
more than one context
nested context

3rd party tools - application level state mgmt.
flux - 
redux  -  
redux toolkit -
root comp. will be the provider 
in one app only one store 

unidirectional 


redux - predictable state container for JS applications.
npm i redux 

@reduxjs/toolkit - npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
react binding -> npm i react-redux 

terminlogies -
1. store - (where all app state resides)
2. action (event)
3. reducer - (pure functions)
4. state (data )
5. view (react app)

view ---> action -----> reducer ------> store (state)

store----> view 

=================================
Soda Shop 
soda/icecream/lassi/mocktails  -> state
counter /shelf -> store
shopkeeper  -  reducer
customer - view 
BUY -  action 

customer --------> BUY------>shopkeeper--------------> shelf (soda ,icecream,lassi,mocktails)
(view)         (Action)       reducer (function)           store (state)

shelf------------> customer 
      select

Dealer -------> SELL ----> shopkeeper--------> shelf 
(view)        action        reducer             store 

Action Dispatch  - useDispatch() hook (react-redux)
select -> useSelector() hook (React-redux)

Single Source of Truth (only one store in one application)

Slices -> 1 slice - soda , 1slice-icecream ,  1slice- lassi , 1slice-mocktails

slice -> reducer functions
